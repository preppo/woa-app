                                          WOA-APP SOURCE CODE.

App is a community messaging hub similar to discord but one central server, there is still friends lists and dms though.
It is hosted on private servers with open source hard-ware, Linux, and encrypted bandwith ensuring the community is fully
private, encrypted and secure. The server will be focusing on my goal of a full open source eco-system (software and hardware for PC and Mobile) 
      which takes the power away from big corp conglomerates and puts it back into the hands of the people. 

As someone who has been attacked with surveilance and digital spying by elon musk the prick, I have made it my goal to fully create an open 
source eco-system to create a better tech world where people who purchase  devices and software can truly own their devices which they pay 
hard earned money for. imagine paying for a device and then it spys on you without even disclosing it in the terms of service, not on my watch 
you corporate nigars. The CIA NIGARS are probably paying them extra to to keep the back doors too I would imagine. Also black people are welcome, 
                                   contrary to popular belief I like nigars.

 The other aspect of the server is intended for those interested in philosophy and religion but mostly Islam. Hence the name (W.O.A)
 if you are not muslim but interested in the goal of a fully open source eco-system of course you are still welcome to join and engange in 
    that aspect of the project, and hey you never know, you may learn a thing or two about our god Allah, praise to be him xd

(Repo is intended for inspection purposes, no point in hosting your own version but you can if you really wanted to lol but the main point
           is having a fully secure and private community which can discuss the goal of an open source eco system)


revolt fork with extra changes to better suit w.o.a specific use cases so shout out to those nigars

             app is non profit, they released it publicly. thats quite fair imo
