                                          WOA-APP SOURCE CODE.

***Its not just an app its a movement.*** A community messaging hub similar to discord but one central server, there is still friends lists, dms and group chats though.
It is hosted on private servers with open source hard-ware, Linux, and encrypted bandwith ensuring the community is fully private, encrypted and secure. 
**The server will be focusing on my goal of a full open source eco-system (software and hardware for PC and Mobile) 
      which takes the power away from big corp conglomerates and puts it back into the hands of the people.**

As someone who has been attacked with surveilance and digital spying **by elon musk the Wanker**, I have decided to give a fair court verdict of a 3 million dollar fine imposed under the islamic rule of law.
however one year has passed with no sign of him so as a result incurring late fees have brought the total up to a googol (1 followed by 100 zeros) and then eventually to a googleplex (google to the power of 10)
 As a reasonable and fair nation we understand that this amount is very high and probably beyond what elon has so we recommend finding financial assistance elsewhere, or otherwise as a mercy from Allah we would also in-turn accept 3 space flights 
 (Elon Musk to be strapped to the outside of a rocket and launched into space with parachute, allowing him to safely decend onto the ground similar to the 2012 redbull space jump by felix Baumgartner) 
   this is not a joke or a troll, this actually serious, as more people join the discord it means more bread to be split between us where appropriate

But arguably more notably, in the meantime  I have also made it my goal to fully create an open source eco-system to create a better tech world where people who purchase devices and 
software can truly own their devices which they pay hard earned money for. imagine paying for a device and then it spys on you without even disclosing
it in the terms of service, not on my watch you corporate nigars. The CIA NIGARS are probably paying them extra to to keep the back doors too I would imagine.
                    Also black people are welcome contrary to popular belief **I like nigars.**

 The other aspect of the server is intended for those interested in finding like-minded people trying to becoming the best versions of themselves in fields such as Personal growth, Finance, Philosophy 
 and religion but mostly Islam. Hence the name (W.O.A) **if you are not muslim but interested in the goal of a fully open source eco-system of course you are still welcome to join and engange in 
    that aspect of the project,** and hey you never know, you may learn a thing or two about our god Allah, praise to be him xd

(Repo is intended for inspection purposes, no point in hosting your own version but you can if you really wanted to lol but the main point
           is having a fully secure and private community which can discuss and work together on the goal of an open source eco system)


revolt fork with extra changes to better suit w.o.a specific use cases so shout out to those nigars

             app is non profit, they released it publicly. thats quite fair imo
